# MiniBalance
- MiniBalance is a tiny (hence its name) yet smart multilingual spreadsheet to assist balancing of air flows in mechanical ventilation systems, i.e. adjusting dampers and air terminal devices. It is a timesaving tool for HVAC/TABS contractors, using a smartphone, tablet or laptop. MiniBalance applies the accurate proportional method of balancing, in combination with other fluid dynamics theory.
- The spreadsheet contains no macros, and can thus be used in any spreadhseet application that can open Microsoft Office Excel XLSX files, for example OpenOffice (PC/linux/Mac), and spreadsheet apps designed for iPhone/iPad and Android hendheld devices.
- Presently, 9 languages are supported. See the appendix of the User Guide. The chosen interface language affects all headings and output, but not the popup comments.
- The spreadsheet is distributed together with a detailed User Guide that gives step-by-step explanations of how to balance systmatically and accurately by the proportional method. The guide also gives tips about time-saving in Chapter 6 (daisy-chaining), how to balance large/complex systems in Chapters 8 & 9, and even how to tackle large systems that lack branch dampers in Chapters 10 & 11.

# MiniBalance
MiniBalance is a tiny (hence its name) yet smart spread-sheet to assist balancing of air flows in mechanical ventilation systems, i.e. adjusting dampers and air terminal devices. It is a timesaving tool for HVAC/TABS contractors, using a smartphone, tablet or laptop. MiniBalance applies the accurate proportional method of balancing, in combination with other fluid dynamics theory.

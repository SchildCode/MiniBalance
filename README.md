# MiniBalance
- MiniBalance is a tiny (hence its name) yet smart spread-sheet to assist balancing of air flows in mechanical ventilation systems, i.e. adjusting dampers and air terminal devices. It is a timesaving tool for HVAC/TABS contractors, using a smartphone, tablet or laptop. MiniBalance applies the accurate proportional method of balancing, in combination with other fluid dynamics theory.
- The spreadsheet contains no macros, and can thus be used in any spreadhseet application that can open Microsoft Office Excel XLSX files, for example OpenOffice (PC/linux/Mac), and spreadsheet apps designed for iPhone/iPad and Android hendheld devices.
- Presently, 9 languages are supported. See the table in the appendix. The chosen interface language affects all headings and output, but not the popup comments
